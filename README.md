This project is dedicated to exploring sentiment analysis in social media content, with a particular emphasis on tweets referencing notable companies or brands like Microsoft, Verizon, and League of Legends. The objective is to automatically classify these tweets into one of three sentiment categories: positive, negative, or neutral. These classifications are based on the sentiments and opinions expressed toward the mentioned entities. By leveraging sentiment analysis techniques, the project aims to provide insights into real-time public perception, measure customer satisfaction, and identify evolving sentiment trends surrounding these brands.

The process began with preparing and refining a labeled dataset of tweets. This included cleaning the data by removing duplicates, irrelevant columns, and noisy information such as special characters or non-alphabetic content. Sentiment labels were encoded into numerical values to facilitate machine learning algorithms. Text preprocessing was a critical step in the pipeline, involving tasks such as converting all text to lowercase, stripping out non-alphanumeric symbols, and applying TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to extract meaningful features for the analysis. To ensure the reliability of the evaluation, the dataset was split into two parts: 80 percent was allocated for training, while the remaining 20 percent was reserved for testing. These splits were saved as CSV files to support reproducibility and further experimentation.

The project trained a machine learning model, specifically a logistic regression classifier, to predict sentiment labels with high accuracy. The trained model achieved an accuracy score of 75.83 percent, along with precision, recall, and F1 scores of approximately 75.72 percent. These metrics demonstrated the model's consistent and reliable performance across all sentiment classes. In addition to the trained model, a baseline comparison was conducted using a Random Classifier, which achieved an accuracy of only 32.8 percent, with similarly low values for precision, recall, and F1 scores. This stark contrast underscored the logistic regression modelâ€™s superior capability, as it outperformed random guessing by a substantial margin, making it a dependable tool for real-time sentiment analysis. By achieving these results, the project successfully demonstrated the feasibility of using machine learning techniques to analyze and interpret sentiment in social media posts, providing actionable insights for brands and companies to understand their public image and customer feedback in a timely manner.
