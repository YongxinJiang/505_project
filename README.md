This project focuses on analyzing sentiment in social media posts, particularly tweets related to specific companies or brands such as Microsoft, Verizon, and League of Legends. The goal is to automatically categorize these tweets into three primary sentiment classes: positive, negative, or neutral, based on the opinions and feedback expressed toward the mentioned brands. By using sentiment analysis techniques, the project aims to identify real-time public perception, customer satisfaction, and sentiment trends surrounding these entities.

The analysis involved preparing and processing a labeled dataset of tweets, which included cleaning the data, removing irrelevant columns, and encoding sentiment labels as numerical values. Text preprocessing steps, such as removing non-alphabetic characters, converting text to lowercase, and applying TF-IDF for feature extraction, were performed to prepare the data. The dataset was split into an 80 percent training set and a 20 percent test set, which were saved as CSV files for further analysis.

A model was trained for sentiment prediction, achieving 75.83 percent accuracy, with precision, recall, and F1 scores around 75.72 percent, reflecting consistent performance. For comparison, a baseline method using a Random Classifier resulted in an accuracy of 32.8 percent, with similar values for precision, recall, and F1 score. This comparison highlights the effectiveness of the trained logistic regression model, which significantly outperformed random guessing in predicting sentiment, demonstrating its reliability for real-time sentiment analysis.
